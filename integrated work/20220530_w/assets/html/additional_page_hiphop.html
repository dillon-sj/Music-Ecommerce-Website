          <h3>History</h3>
          <p>The Bronx neighborhood of New York City was the birthplace of early hip-hop music in the 1970s. It began as a cooperative effort by intersecting Black, Latinx, and Caribbean American youth groups during block parties, which were neighborhood events where DJs played soul and funk music. Longer percussive breaks (also known as "breakbeats" or simply "the breaks"), turntable tricks, scratching, freestyle, and improvised vocals based on Jamaican "toasting" were some of the new techniques that NYC DJs like DJ Kool Herc, Grand Wizzard Theodore, Grandmaster Flash, and Afrika Bambaataa started experimenting with during parties. They are frequently cited as the creators of contemporary hip-hop and rap music. </p>

          <p>Unique things about this style of music mainly is they have a strong, rhythmic beat. They have very strong vocals and the music has breaks and etc. Hip-hop music is most strongly unified by a steady beat. It moves the song along smoothly and provides a backdrop for the vocal delivery, whether it's quick and forceful or sluggish and laid back. The majority of hip-hop beats aren't just straightforward drum beats; rather, beat-making is a complex and diversified art form that gives rise to other songs and sounds.</p>

          <p>Hip-hop is not only a musical style; it is a culture that has transformed America since the 1980s. Its impact on American politics and media culture has spread across the country. For many years, the controversy surrounding hip-hop music and culture has been in the spotlight. It continues to be a hot topic, with everything from the excitement of the east-west rivalry to critics who are quick to point out rap's violent lyrics. Hip-negative hop's connotations can occasionally overpower the power of the music. However, people could misinterpret the meanings that music is trying to convey. Hip-hop may evoke emotion while simultaneously bringing attention to a number of important cultural issues, such as racism and misogyny. </p>
